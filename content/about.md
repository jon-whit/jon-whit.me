 👋🏼 My name is Jonathan Whitaker. I’m an outdoor enthusiast by day, software engineer by trade, and I love to build things. In my free time I love to mountain bike, ski, fly fish, and explore new places. Staying active keeps me intrigued.

I also genuinely enjoy learning new things and reading a variety of technical content. My latest professional interests revolve around distributed systems. I have taken a particular interest in distributed consensus algorithms such as Raft, and also gossip basic protocols. And more importantly, how to apply these to real-world practical problems such as distributed databases, messaging, and authorization services. You’ll see me write more about these things in my articles.
